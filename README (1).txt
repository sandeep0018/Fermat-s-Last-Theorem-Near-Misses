Fermat's Last Theorem Comes Up Short

Fermat's Last Near Miss Theorem is used in this program.
A "near miss" of the form using this theorem
The theorem is used to calculate the miss and relative miss values.
and it is used to search for users.
The Java programming language is used to fully implement this program.
The function is defined to execute the formula as needed.

Step 1: Declare the required variable names as stored by a valued

Step 2: I will check the n value between 2 and 12. Users enter the value.

Step 3: The user enters the k-value limit. Check to see if the k value is less than 10 or not.

Step 4: A for loop is used to iterate over the x and y values less than the k value to check them out.
        to find the n value If the value is not below that, print the error message.

Step 5: The n value is used to calculate the Miss value.

Step 6: Using n and the miss value, the relative miss value is calculated.

Step 7: Finally, print all of the values.
